# congklak
Intelligent Systems Final project

# Abstract
My team is planning to make a simulation of a traditional game called Congklak. The simulation will be built on Python language on the top of Pygame extension. It will have a PvP feature where you can play against another player in 1 computer. Aside from that, it will also have a PvE feature, where you can challenge the computer to play. The AI there will have the ability to predict our movements and take the best move based on the prediction. At the end of the simulation, you can know how many times you’ve made movements and how many predictions have been made. Furthermore, it will also have a page containing the general information about Congklak and how to play it.

# About
According to Indonesia.go.id (2019), Congklak is one of 2,600 traditional games in Indonesia. This game has many names, in Java this game is familiar as Dhakon. Congkak is a name that develops in Sumatra, while in Lampung the game is popularly known as the slow boom. In Arabic, Congklak is called Mancala, in English ‘mancala’ means ‘to move’.

The game of Congklak has long been developing in Asia, especially the Malay region. Historically, Congklak first entered and developed in Indonesia brought by the Arabs who came to trade and preach. Archaeologists and some experts believe that Congklak originated in the Middle East and then spread to Africa. Then, Congklak developed into Asia by Arab traders. Many experts suspect that the Congklak game may be the oldest board game ever in the world (Indonesia.go.id, 2019).

# How to Play
- Played by 2 players.

- Using a board with a length of 40-50 centimeters consisting of 14 small holes facing each other and two large holes on both sides (right and left).

- Each player will get seven small holes and one large hole.

- Small holes are filled with 5-7 seeds/shells, while large holes are left empty, assuming the large holes are the player’s storage shed.

- 2 players take turns to choose one of his/her small holes to be moved one by one to the other in a clockwise direction, until the seeds/shells in his/her hand are out.

- The game will end when all the small holes are empty, and all the seeds/shells are in the big hole.

- The win is determined by the highest number of seeds/shells in the big hole of each player.

# Point of Features
- PvP feature.

- PvE feature.

- AI will be able to predict our movements.

- Statistical information about player’s movements and AI’s predictions.

- General information & how to play.
